## [OUT OF DATE]
It has certainly been a while since I've last thought about updating my portfolio. The last portfolio I worked on for myself was in 2018 (5 years ago, yikes!). Over the years I have learned so much about front end development that it was probably about time to create a new portfolio for myself.

## [INSPIRATION AND FOCUS]
The next step was for me to look through some modern portfolios and designs around the web. I've scoured through sites like awwwards, dribbble, and behance to gather some ideas. As I was scouring through some of these amazing sites, alot of them had a common theme that had caught my eye... 3D. 

I had always wanted give a shot at adding an extra dimension to my work. Coincidentally, over the past month I've also been learning and messing around with Blender (a 3d open source modeling software). So what better time than now to give it a fair chance? 

## [KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID]
Since my focus was primarily on implementing 3D, keeping the portfolio design and technology simple could help me minimalize "feature creep". At the same time, I wanted my portfolio to scream what resembled me. That was the easy part -- videogames made up a great part of my life so I decided to center my portfolio around a gaming theme.

For my portfolio I really only needed 2 things: A projects section, a contact section, and later on... a skills section (I know feature creep, but I had a good reason). React (a front end framework), was something I was comfortable with and trying a minimalist design was keeping the simple theme. 

Next was for me to figure out what I do I want to make 3D? 

## [GREASE PENCIL? ðŸ¤”]
Yep you read that right! Grease pencil is a special object in Blender that allows you to draw in a 3D space. This object acts like any other object in blender, which means you can edit, animate, apply textures, and many other things. I was pretty anxious to try something like this since my Blender experience is kind of... lacking. So what's the best way to jump into learning? Youtube!

I mainly watched a 2 part series on youtube to learn more about grease pencil and tried to concoct something of my own. To stick close to my theme gaming and simple, I thought creating a gameboy (and calling it DevBoy) with technologies floating it, and animating it would do for a nice eye-catching hero. (It seems overwhelming, but trust me, as a Blender newbie, even I was able to make something. It was just real tedious.)
